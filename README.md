## Difficulties faced

1. I had to take caution in the Calculator programs to prevent the program from crashing if someone attempted to divide a number by zero. Instead of the program ending I added a check to print an error message.

2. In question 14 and 15 for the prime and factorial I had to use if conditions to handle numbers such as 0 and 1.

3. In question 16 I had to manage the 7 attempts limit and add clues like wether the guessed number was higher or lower and reveal the answer if the user could not guess it in 7 attempts.

4. The main difficulty I faced was in the 20th question how to use // and % together to break a number into simgle digit and reverse them or for palindrome checking.

5. And it was a challenge to combine different functions into single menu.
